bld,Boundary layer dissipation,boundary_layer_dissipation,J m**-2,"This parameter is the amount of energy per unit area that is converted from kinetic energy, into heat, due to small-scale motion in the lower levels of the atmosphere. These small-scale motions are called eddies or turbulence. A higher value of this parameter means that more energy is being converted to heat, and so the mean flow is slowing more and the air temperature is rising by a greater amount. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. (https://apps.ecmwf.int/codes/grib/param-db)"
blh,Boundary layer height,boundary_layer_height,m,"This parameter is the depth of air next to the Earth's surface which is most affected by the resistance to the transfer of momentum, heat or moisture across the surface. The boundary layer height can be as low as a few tens of metres, such as in cooling air at night, or as high as several kilometres over the desert in the middle of a hot sunny day. When the boundary layer height is low, higher concentrations of pollutants (emitted from the Earth's surface) can develop. The boundary layer height calculation is based on the bulk Richardson number (a measure of the atmospheric conditions) following the conclusions of a 2012 review."
cape,CAPE,convective_available_potential_energy,J kg**-1,"This is an indication of the instability (or stability) of the atmosphere and can be used to assess the potential for the development of convection, which can lead to heavy rainfall, thunderstorms and other severe weather. In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), CAPE is calculated by considering parcels of air departing at different model levels below the 350 hPa level. If a parcel of air is more buoyant (warmer and/or with more moisture) than its surrounding environment, it will continue to rise (cooling as it rises) until it reaches a point where it no longer has positive buoyancy. CAPE is the potential energy represented by the total excess buoyancy. The maximum CAPE produced by the different parcels is the value retained. Large positive values of CAPE indicate that an air parcel would be much warmer than its surrounding environment and therefore, very buoyant. CAPE is related to the maximum potential vertical velocity of air within an updraft; thus, higher values indicate greater potential for severe weather. Observed values in thunderstorm environments often may exceed 1000 joules per kilogram (J kg-1), and in extreme cases may exceed 5000 J kg-1. The calculation of this parameter assumes: (i) the parcel of air does not mix with surrounding air; (ii) ascent is pseudo-adiabatic (all condensed water falls out) and (iii) other simplifications related to the mixed-phase condensational heating."
cbh,Cloud base height,cloud_base_height,m,"The height above the Earth's surface of the base of the lowest cloud layer, at the specified time. This parameter is calculated by searching from the second lowest model level upwards, to the height of the level where cloud fraction becomes greater than 1% and condensate content greater than 1.E-6 kg kg-1. Fog (i.e., cloud in the lowest model layer) is not considered when defining cloud base height. (https://apps.ecmwf.int/codes/grib/param-db)"
cin_valid,CIN presence,convective_inhibition,J kg**-1,"This parameter is a measure of the amount of energy required for convection to commence. If the value of this parameter is too high, then deep, moist convection is unlikely to occur even if the convective available potential energy or convective available potential energy shear are large. CIN values greater than 200 J kg-1 would be considered high. An atmospheric layer where temperature increases with height (known as a temperature inversion) would inhibit convective uplift and is a situation in which convective inhibition would be large.

This parameter is the total amount of water accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. The units of this parameter are depth in metres of water equivalent. It is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.

msl,Mean sea level pressure,mean_sea_level_pressure,Pa,"This parameter is the pressure (force per unit area) of the atmosphere adjusted to the height of mean sea level. It is a measure of the weight that all the air in a column vertically above the area of Earth's surface would have at that point, if the point were located at the mean sea level. It is calculated over all surfaces - land, sea and in-land water. Maps of mean sea level pressure are used to identify the locations of low and high pressure systems, often referred to as cyclones and anticyclones. Contours of mean sea level pressure also indicate the strength of the wind. Tightly packed contours show stronger winds. The units of this parameter are pascals (Pa). Mean sea level pressure is often measured in hPa and sometimes is presented in the old units of millibars, mb (1 hPa = 1 mb = 100 Pa). (https://apps.ecmwf.int/codes/grib/param-db)"
mvimd,Moisture divergence,mean_vertically_integrated_moisture_divergence,kg m**-2 s**-1,"The vertical integral of the moisture flux is the horizontal rate of flow of moisture (water vapour, cloud liquid and cloud ice), per metre across the flow, for a column of air extending from the surface of the Earth to the top of the atmosphere. Its horizontal divergence is the rate of moisture spreading outward from a point, per square metre. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. This parameter is positive for moisture that is spreading out, or diverging, and negative for the opposite, for moisture that is concentrating, or converging (convergence). This parameter thus indicates whether atmospheric motions act to decrease (for divergence) or increase (for convergence) the vertical integral of moisture, over the time period. High negative values of this parameter (i.e. large moisture convergence) can be related to precipitation intensification and floods. 1 kg of water spread over 1 square metre of surface is 1 mm deep (neglecting the effects of temperature on the density of water), therefore the units are equivalent to mm.

Evaporation from the Earth's surface represents a transfer of energy from the surface to the atmosphere. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted.The units are joules per square metre (J m-2).

The magnitude of the sensible heat flux is governed by the difference in temperature between the surface and the overlying atmosphere, wind speed and the surface roughness. For example, cold air overlying a warm surface would produce a sensible heat flux from the land (or ocean) into the atmosphere. This is a single level parameter and it is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted.The units are joules per square metre (J m-2).

The remainder is incident on the Earth's surface, where some of it is reflected. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. The units are joules per square metre (J m-2). To convert to watts per square metre (W m-2), the accumulated values should be divided by the accumulation period expressed in seconds.
